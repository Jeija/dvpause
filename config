Format of the config File:
First, a line containing __BASEDIR only must be given.
The line directly after that one contains the directory that all files are in.
You can use __CWD__ as a wildcard for the current working directory at the beginning
of the line.
Every movie entry starts with a line containing __MOVIE. The first line afterwards contains the
name of the movie, the second line the filename of the movie in the folder provided at basedir.
Any other lines will be ignored, just like this text up here.



__BASEDIR
__CWD__/videos/

You can also use absolute directories:
/home/username/Videos/dvswitch_videos/


__MOVIE
Big Buck Bunny (Excerpt)
bigbuckbunny.dv

__MOVIE
Sintel (Excerpt)
sintel.dv
